Arduino Library for
ClosedCube SGP30 Multi-Pixel TVOC/CO2 Gas breakout board
===

This is breakout board for [Sensirion SGP30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/multi-pixel-gas-sensors/)
 Multi-pixel gas sensor for indoor air quality (TVOC and CO2eq outputs) with [Texas Instruments TPS62743](http://www.ti.com/product/TPS62743) Ultralow Quiescent Current Buck Converter

**Features:**
 - Output:
    - Total VOC in ppb
    - H2-based CO2eq in ppm
 - Output range:
    -  TVOC: 0 – 60'000 ppb
    -  CO2eq: 0 – 60'000 ppm
 - Typical accuracy: 15% of measured value
 - Support 5V and 3.3V I2C buses
 - I2C digital interface with 0x58 address
 - Supply voltage range: 2.2 to 5.5 V
 - 1.8V output up to 300mA
 

**Note:** The library depends on: [ClosedCube I2C Driver for Arduino](https://github.com/closedcube/ClosedCube_I2C_Arduino)
